            <h2>Foundation and Ancient Period</h2>
            <p>
              Málaga was founded by the Phoenicians around the 8th century BCE
              under the name Malaka, making it one of the oldest cities in
              Europe. Later, it was occupied by the Carthaginians, and in the
              2nd century BCE, it became part of the Roman Empire. Under Roman
              rule, Málaga thrived thanks to maritime trade and the production
              of wine, olive oil, and salted fish, which were exported to other
              parts of the Empire.

            <h2>Muslim Málaga and Christian Reconquest</h2>
            <p>
              In 711 CE, the Moors conquered the city, and Málaga became a vital
              port and economic center for the Kingdom of Granada due to its
              Mediterranean access and agricultural production. During Muslim
              rule, the city flourished, and landmarks like the Alcazaba
              fortress and Gibralfaro Castle were built. In 1487, after a
              prolonged siege, Málaga was captured by the Catholic Monarchs,
              integrating it into the Kingdom of Castile.

            <h2>Modern and Contemporary Era</h2>
            <p>
              In the 18th and 19th centuries, Málaga underwent a major
              transformation, becoming one of Spain's most industrialized cities
              with significant growth in iron and textile industries. In the
              20th century, after industrial decline, Málaga reinvented itself
              as a cultural and tourist destination. Today, it stands as a
              vibrant, modern city known for its cultural offerings,
              Mediterranean climate, and prominent role in international
              tourism.
